      <p id="explain"> My favourite hobby is to do coding in my free time. Coding is treally fun for me because you make make your games and also play with them. You can make certain types of stuff like calculators, games, webpages and even your own searching browser. Fun, right? You can also share your page around the world and people will play your game that you built! You dont know how to code? No problem! You can take classes and the teachers will teach you how to code! See how fun coding is? Well, you can try yourself!</p>
